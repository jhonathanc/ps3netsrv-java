# ps3netsrv-java
Java ps3netsrv

Work in progress.

Features missing from original ps3netsrv that I still wants to develop:
1. Multi part ISO.
2. Virtual ISO from "JB Games".
3. Encrypted ISO.
4. ~~Whitelist / Blacklist of client IP's.~~
5. ~~Limit the maximum number of clients.~~

The project is developed using only native Java libraries to avoid problems with licensing.

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR.
